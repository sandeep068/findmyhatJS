Description : This project related to building an
interactive terminal game with JavaScript classes.

In this project, I build an interactive terminal game. 
The scenario is that the player has lost their hat 
in a field full of holes, and they must have to 
navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or 
stepping outside of the field.
